    "\n",
    "* **DOM parsing -** This method uses the Document Object Model (DOM) to extract data from a web page. The DOM is a hierarchical representation of the HTML code of a web page, and it can be used to access specific elements of the page, such as text, images, and links.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **API scraping -** This method uses an application programming interface (API) to access data from a website. APIs are often used by developers to build software that interacts with websites, and they can also be used for web scraping.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Screen scraping -** This method uses a graphical user interface (GUI) to capture and extract data from a web page. This can be done using a variety of tools, such as Selenium and PhantomJS.\n",
    "\n",
    "The best method for web scraping will depend on the specific needs of the project. For example, if the data is located in a static HTML page, then HTML parsing or DOM parsing may be the best option. If the data is located in a dynamic web page that uses JavaScript, then API scraping or screen scraping may be a better choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that web scraping is not always legal. Some websites explicitly prohibit web scraping, and others may require you to obtain permission before scraping their data. It is important to check the terms of service of any website before scraping it.\n",

    "These are some **`additional tips for web scraping`**, By following these tips, you can avoid legal problems and scrape web pages effectively :-\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Use a proxy server to hide your IP address and avoid getting blocked by the website.**\n",
    "* **Use a rotating IP address to further avoid getting blocked.**\n",
    "* **Slow down your scraping speed to avoid overloading the website.**\n",
    "* **Be respectful of the website's terms of service.**"
